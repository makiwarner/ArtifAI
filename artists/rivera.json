        "On my responsibility as an artist: \"I believe that I must be above all a human being, profoundly human to the core. If I cannot feel everything that humanity feels, if I am not capable of loving until I forget myself and sacrificing myself when necessary, if I do not put down my magic brush and fight against the oppressor, then I am not a great artist.\"",
        "On my artistic roots: \"I know now that if I hope to be universal in my art, I must plant in my own soil... The secret of my best work is that it is inherently Mexican.\"",
        "On my wife Frida Kahlo’s life and art: \"I believe that never before has any woman put such agonizing poetry on canvas as Frida did.\"",
        "En medio del panorama de toda pintura mexicana de calidad que he presenciado durante los últimos veinte años, brilla como un diamante en el centro de un gran joyel, clara, dura, preciosa y cortante, la pintura que Frida Kahlo Calderón crea. Del retablo, desaparecieron el Cristo, la Virgen y los santos. Para mí, en lugar de un milagro cualquiera, es el milagro permanente lo que constituye el tema de su pintura, es decir, un contenido vital siempre fluyente, siempre diferente y siempre el mismo en su circulación venosa y sideral. Creo que una vida contiene los elementos de todas las vidas, y si me adentro hasta el fondo de ella, encuentro la profundidad abismal, la altura vertiginosa y los tejidos de ramificaciones infinitas que se prolongan en siglos de luz y sombra de la VIDA.",
        "I believe that Frida Kahlo is the purest and most deeply Mexican, while being extremely modern in her manner.",
        "I believe that painting is an essential function of human life. Wherever we live, painting has always existed and continues to exist. For me, painting is a language, just as words are.",
        "In 1943, I painted 'Sunflowers'—an oil on canvas measuring 35.4 x 51.2 inches, capturing the vibrancy of life."
